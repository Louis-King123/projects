To connect run:
    mysql -uroot

mysql@5.7 is keg-only, which means it was not symlinked into /usr/local,
because this is an alternate version of another formula.

If you need to have mysql@5.7 first in your PATH run:
  echo 'export PATH="/usr/local/opt/mysql@5.7/bin:$PATH"' >> ~/.zshrc

For compilers to find mysql@5.7 you may need to set:
  export LDFLAGS="-L/usr/local/opt/mysql@5.7/lib"
  export CPPFLAGS="-I/usr/local/opt/mysql@5.7/include"


To have launchd start mysql@5.7 now and restart at login:
  brew services start mysql@5.7
Or, if you don't want/need a background service you can just run:
  /usr/local/opt/mysql@5.7/bin/mysql.server start

==> openssl@1.1
A CA file has been bootstrapped using certificates from the system
keychain. To add additional certificates, place .pem files in
  /usr/local/etc/openssl@1.1/certs

and run
  /usr/local/opt/openssl@1.1/bin/c_rehash

openssl@1.1 is keg-only, which means it was not symlinked into /usr/local,
because macOS provides LibreSSL.

If you need to have openssl@1.1 first in your PATH run:
  echo 'export PATH="/usr/local/opt/openssl@1.1/bin:$PATH"' >> ~/.zshrc

For compilers to find openssl@1.1 you may need to set:
  export LDFLAGS="-L/usr/local/opt/openssl@1.1/lib"
  export CPPFLAGS="-I/usr/local/opt/openssl@1.1/include"
